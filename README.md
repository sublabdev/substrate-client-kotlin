# Sublab's Substrate Client Kotlin library

This is a main Kotlin repository of our organization which uses all of other repositories and combines them to provide tools to connect to Substrate based blockchain networks.

Currently, only primary (relaychain) networks are fully tested, but this repository is subject to change when we add more networks support, including parachains and separate independent networks.

## Sublab

At Sublab we're making mobile-first libraries for developers in [Substrate](https://substrate.io) ecosystem. However, we seek our libraries to be available not only for mobile Apple OS or Android OS, but compatible with any Swift/Kotlin environment: web servers, desktop apps, and whatnot.

Our mission is to to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. 

Our goal is to have more developers to come into the world of development of client applications in Substrate ecosystem, as we find this as most promising and intelligent blockchain project we ever seen. Thus, we as mobile development gurus trying to create enormously professional libraries which might be very complicated under the hood, but very simple and convenient for final developers.
